* If the -b flag is used, and the system put to sleep, but then the user
  resumes it with the battery still low, it will go to sleep again. This
  type of tug-of-war with the user isn't nice. It would be better to only
  go to sleep the first time the battery goes low, then never again until
  it gets higher again. Hmm.
* Sleepd cannot work right with a usb mouse (since there could easily be
  other USB traffic on the same interrupt). It has similar problems with
  shared interrupts in general. Bug #147678
