Description: puts a laptop to sleep during inactivity
 This is a daemon to force laptops to enter apm sleep after some 
 period of inactivity. This is useful if your laptop does not automatically
 go to sleep when you aren't using it, and, like me, you often forget to
 shut it off.
 .
 The daemon can also be configured to put a laptop to sleep if its battery 
 nearly runs out of power.
