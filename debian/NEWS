sleepd (2.00) unstable; urgency=low

  Two things have been modernised in this version of sleepd that might
  cause it to behave differently.

  Instead of checking for activity by interrupts, sleepd now defaults to using
  the /dev/input/event* files. The old behavior can be obtained by running
  sleepd with the '-E -a' flags.

  To put a system to sleep, sleepd now uses the pm-suspend command,
  instead of hibernate --force. To continue using hibernate,
  use the -d flag.
