sleepd (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACPI support. Have to use software suspend to sleep though (unless you're
    Linus or something), and so there is some manual tweaking required.
  * Changed the default check period to 10 seconds, as ACPI is a mite more
    expensive, and anything under a minute should really be fine.
  * Support use of -b w/o -U flag.
  * Support -u 0 to disable idle checking.
  * Made -s actually work.
  * debhelper v4

sleepd (1.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Renamed this package and the daemon from apm-sleep to sleepd,
    after observing that apmsleep is a program in the apm package.
    Anyway, daemons should end in 'd'.
  * Remove any sleepd.ctl on purge.
  * The magic in the preinst should transition both conffiles transparently
    to the admin.

  * Fixed two typos that prevented it from ever sleeping except in low
    power situations.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 21 Jun 2001 21:30:35 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the apm-sleep control file to /var/run/, so it is removed on
    reboots. I want the control data to persist accross daemon restarts,
    but not reboots.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 15 Jun 2001 20:37:33 -0400

apm-sleep (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added sleepctl program.
  * Removed bogus changelog entry that was meant for wmbattery (so _that's_
    where the mysterious missing changelog entry went!).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jun 2001 23:35:06 -0400

apm-sleep (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the init script ensure that the apm module is loaded by
    touching /dev/apm_bios. Closes: #95792

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Apr 2001 13:21:14 -0400

apm-sleep (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

apm-sleep (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper installs the default file now for me.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Feb 2001 18:16:17 -0800

apm-sleep (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added install target to Makefile.
  * Added local website mantainance install-hook in.
  * Created a website.
  * Added another copy of the GPL to my cvs repository. Sigh.
  * Added INSTALL document.
  * First public release outside Debian.

apm-sleep (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * I discovered that apm-sleep would run before X or gpm were started, and
    there would be no mouse irq in the list, so it would not autoprobe it.
    The fix is to make it autoprobe for keyboard and mouse every time
    through the main loop. I do this with pretty little additional
    overhead, really. It should also make autoprobing work if a device is
    connected or enabled or whatever when the daemon is running (I'm
    thinking USB..) Closes: #80173

apm-sleep (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Stephen Rothwell <sfr@linuxcare.com.au> to:
    - add ac-unused option
    - add some paramater checking
    - add check-time option
  * Added a new TODO item to replace the one Steven did.
  * Build-depends on apmd now.
  * Modified above patch a bit. -U 0 will disable sleep completly
    when on wall power, and if -U is not specified, it defaults to
    using whatever the regular suspend time is.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Dec 2000 22:59:12 -0800

apm-sleep (0.3) unstable; urgency=low
